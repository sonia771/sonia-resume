        <p class="lead mb-4">Hello, I am first generation college student, who's majoring in Political Science/International Affairs<br><br>

        I have a diverse background spanning sales, hospitality, customer service, and event management; I've developed a versatile skill set that allows me to thrive in dynamic environments. Let's dive into my experiences and how they have shaped me personally and professionally. My path began as an Advanced Sales Representative at Vector, where I honed my ability to connect with clients and exceed sales targets. Through targeted marketing strategies, active client engagement, and a customer-centric approach, I consistently delivered tailored solutions that met and surpassed their expectations. This role fostered my interpersonal and persuasive skills, enabling me to forge strong, lasting client relationships. I am proud of my track record of success in driving business growth while maintaining the highest standards of professionalism.Seeking to broaden my horizons, I ventured into the world of hospitality as a server at the esteemed Epicurean Group. This experience allowed me to showcase my dedication to delivering exceptional service while providing memorable dining experiences to guests. By actively listening to their preferences, offering personalized recommendations, and ensuring their utmost satisfaction, I contributed to creating a warm and welcoming atmosphere. The fast-paced nature of the job taught me the importance of effective multitasking, teamwork, and adaptability, all of which remain invaluable skills in my professional repertoire.<br><br>

        Additionally, I had the privilege of serving as an usher at the Fox Performing Arts Center. Working in the vibrant realm of live events, I had the opportunity to contribute to the smooth operation of various performances, ranging from plays and concerts to cultural events. As an usher, I ensured attendees' safety and comfort and played a pivotal role in enhancing their overall experience. This position nurtured my organizational skills, attention to detail, and ability to handle unexpected challenges gracefully. Above all, being a part of the arts community filled me with joy and inspiration. Before my venture into sales, I served as a TSA Agent at the San Francisco International Airport. In this crucial role, I was entrusted with maintaining the safety and security of travelers. I diligently screened passengers and their belongings and demonstrated a solid commitment to adhering to protocols and regulations. The experience heightened my attention to detail, ability to remain calm under pressure, and adeptness at providing exceptional customer service in a fast-paced environment. Outside of my professional pursuits, I am an avid traveler who embraces new cultures, seeking inspiration from the world's diverse experiences. I am also passionate about photography, using it as a creative outlet to capture the beauty in everyday moments. Engaging in these activities nourishes my soul and fosters my creativity, which I bring into my professional endeavors.
